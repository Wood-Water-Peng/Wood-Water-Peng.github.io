#### 概述

关系子句简化之后，剩下的就是原来主语的补语部分，可以分成现在分词片语、过去分词片语、形容词、名词等几种情况。

如果关系子句的动词片语中有语气助动词存在，则会简化成不定词片语。

##### 简化为分词

若动词是普通动词，则需要加上-ing进行词类变化，变成现在分词。

**现在分词**

>The man who wants to see you is waiting ourside.
>
>The man `wanting to see you` is waiting ourside


>My Encyclopedia,which is lying on the bookshelf and gathering dust,has seldom been used.

>My Encyclopedia,`lying on the bookshelf and gathering dust`,has seldom been used.

完成式

>Anyone that has visited Bali once will want to return.
>
>Anyone `having visited Bali once` will want to return.

**过去分词**

>Grapes that are grown in the Champagne area make the best wines.
>
>Grapes `grown in the Champagne area` make the best wines.

>Microsoft,which is accused of monopolizing the OS market,will have to change its business practice.
>
>Microsoft,accused of monopolizing the OS market,will have to change its business practice.

完成式

>A student who has been trained at this school is guaranteed to excel in any exam.
>
>A student `having been trained at this school` is guaranteed to excel in any exam.
>
>因为过去分词trained本身就带有完成的暗示，所以可改成
>
>A student `trained at this school` is guaranteed to excel in any exam.


##### 简化为形容词

S+V+C句型，补语为形容词，那么简化be动词之后，剩下的就是单纯的形容词补语

>A chimpanzee is an animal that is capable of reason.
>
>A chimpanzee is an animal `capable of reason`.

>The boy,who is usually tall and heavy for his age,wants to be a sumo wrestler.
>
>The boy,usually tall and heavy for his age,wants to be a sumo wrestler


##### 简化为名词

此所谓同位格

>The Great Wall of China,which is the largest man-made structure on earth.
>
>The Great Wall of China,the largest man-made structure on earth.

##### 简化为不定式

在之前的例子中，关系代名词都是关系子句的主语，在你简化时将其省略掉即可。

简化为不定式的先决条件：动词片语必须包含语气助动词

>This is not the right thing which you should do.
>
>This is not the right thing to do.

在上面的例子中，先行词thing是do的受词，我们将从句中的主语you省略后句子的意思仍然是清楚的。

同理如下

>If you want a load,our manager is the person whom you should see.
>
>If you want a load,our manager is the person to see.

地点

>If you like Cantonese food,I know just the place where you can go.
>
>If you like Cantonese food,I know just the place to go.

时间

>This is no time when you should be fooling around.
>
>This is no time to be fooling around.

方式

>I'll show you the way how you can start this machine.
>
>I'll show you the way to start this machine.


##### 不定式片语的语态

>There's still one more person to notify.
>
>There's still one more person to be notified.
>
>There's still one more person whom we must notify.
>
>There's still one more person whom must be notified.

那么，主动被动究竟该如何选择？

* 连贯性原则

尽量让句子的主语相同



>When John stepped into his office,the boss was seen waiting there by him.
>
>When John stepped into his office,he saw the boss waiting there.
>
>Stepping into his office,John saw the boss waiting there.

主动

>I must stay at the office because I have some people to notify.
>
>还原后
>
>I must stay at the office because I have some people whom I must notify.

被动

>The news can't be released yet because there are some people to be notified first.
>
>还原后
>
>The news can't be released yet because there are some people who must be notified first.


##### 不定式的主语如何处理

当关系子句简化为不定式时，他的主语不一定是关系代名词，所以也不一定要和主要子句重复。如果这个主语不重复，也不是笼统的字眼，属于需要交代之列，那么当关系子句简化为不定式时，子句的主语一般是安插在介系词for后面的位置来处理。

>I'm looking for a motorcycle that my wife can ride.
>
>I'm looking for a motorcycle for my wife to ride.
