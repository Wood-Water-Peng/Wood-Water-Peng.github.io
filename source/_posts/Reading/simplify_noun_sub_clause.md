#### 概述

与另外两种从句不同的是，名词子句在主要子句中扮演主词、受词、补语、同位格等角色，经常是不可或缺的元素，简化之后必须保证子句仍然是名词类(如动名词、不定式片语等)。

注意：简化之后剩余的子句必须维持名词的词类，最常见的结果就是简化为动名词(V+ing)和不定式(to+V)

##### 简化为V+ing

**主词位置**

主语可省略

>`That you don't have a cell-phone` can save you a great deal of trouble.
>
>`Not having a cell-phone` can save you a great deal of trouble.

主语不可省略

>That john was drunk is no excuse for the rude behavior.
>
>John's drunkeness is no excuse for the rude behavior.
>
>John's being drunk is no excuse for the rude behavior.

**受词位置**

主语可省略

>I dislike that I am kept waiting.
>
>I dislike being kept waiting.

主语不可省略

>I saw that many birds were flying soouthward.
>
>I saw many birds flying soouthward

**补语位置**

>The actor's greatest achievement is that he has been nominated twice for the Oscar.
>
>The actor's greatest achievement is having been nominated twice for the Oscar.


**同位格**

>I am happy about the fact that you won the prize.
>
>I am happy about you winning the prize.
>
>I am happy about your winning the prize.

再来一个更明显的

>The fact that he is innocent should be obvious to all.
>
>His innocence should be obvious to all.
>
>His being innocence should be obvious to all.

更高级一点的

>I'm surprised that there is no index to the book.
>
>I'm surprised at the fact that there is no index to the book.
>
>I'm surprised at there being no index to the book.


##### 简化为To+V

如果名词子句中有语气助动词，可以将语气助动词简化为to+V,然后省略掉无意义的be动词，剩下的就是不定式。

**来自直述句的名词子句**

* 主词位置

>It is important that one should be honest.
>
>It is important to be honest.
>
>To be honest is important.

比较下面两个例子

`1.That anyone should go on such a mission takes guts.`

`2.That John should go on such a mission is suicide.`

句1中的主词anyone是空洞的，简化时可以省略

`To go on such a mission takes guts.`

句2中的John是有意义的，但是需要被限定

`For John to go on such a mission` is suicide.

如果有[褒贬]语气，则用of

>It is kind that you can say so.
>
>It is kind of you to say so.

* 受词位置

>I hope that I can get a raise next month.
>
>I hope to get a raise nexy month.

**来自疑问句的名词子句**

* Information Question

>I'll tell you what you should do.
>
>I'll tell you `what to do`

试比较下面三个句子：

>1.I'll tell you what to do.
>
>2.I'll tell you when to do the job.
>
>3.I'll tell you what to do the job with.

句1中省略的原句是**what you should do**,what作为do的受词

句1中省略的原句是**when you should do the job**,when作为时间副词

句1中省略的原句是**what you should do the job with**,what作为介系词with的受词

* Yes/No Question

来自Yes/No Question的名词子句会加上从属连接词whether,如果子句中有助动词，就会变成whether to,例如:

>Whether we should go on or not will have to be decided soon.
>
>Whether to go or not will have to be decided soon.
