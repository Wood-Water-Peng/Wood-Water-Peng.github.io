#### 概述

副词子句在简化时，比较特殊的是连接词的处理，当副词子句的连接词既不空洞、又不重复时，需要保留下来，句子的意思才不会有损失。

#### 简化为分词构句

此所谓分词构句

>While I stayed at my uncle's,I dined out every night.
>
>(While）Staying at my uncle's,I dined out every night.

##### 现在分词构句

>Because he was itching to be playing again,the boy inserted more coins.
>
>Itching to be playing again,the boy inserted more coins.

1.句首的副词从句往往有表示[原因]的功能

2.主句和从句的主语相同

同理，句尾的副词从句往往有表示[结果]的功能

##### 过去分词构句

所谓被动态

>If it is provoked,a rhino can be very dangerous.
>
>If provoked,a rhino can be very dangerous.

注意，主句和从句主语相同

>When the job was concluded,the secretary went home.
>
>The job concluded,the secretary went home.

此时，主语是不同的，不可以省略

**Being和Having been的理解**

1. 强调进行状态
2. 进行词类变化

>I was nice.
>
>I was being nice.

**分词构句的位置**


* 句首

>Entering the classromm,the teacher greeted the students.

* 句中

>The teacher entering the classroom greeted the students. 关系子句
>
>The teacher,entering the classroom,greeted the students. 副词从句

* 句尾

>The teacher greeted the students entering the classroom. 关系子句
>
>The teacher greeted the students,entering the classroom. 副词子句

#### 简化为To+V

副词子句中的动词片语中如果包括语气助动词在内，就可以简化为不定式。

如果简化为不定式片语，那么只要意思够清楚，副词子句的主词就可以省略来做简化。

in order to

>The student studied hard in order that he could get a scholarship.
>
>The student studied hard in order to get a scholarship.

so as to

>The boy left home early so that he could be in time for the concert.
>
>The boy left so as to be in time for the concert.

类似的连接词还有so...as to,such...as to,only to,too...to,ehough...to


#### 简化为介系词片语

**补语为介系词片语**

如果副词子句是介系词片语当主词补语，那么简化掉主词与be动词之后，剩下的就是介系词片语

>While on duty,the officer never drinks.

**连词直接转变为介系词**

有一些副词子句的连接词兼有连接词和介系词两种词性，如果后面有限定子句，他就是连接词，如果后面的子句简化了，这些连接词自动变为介系词。

before,after,since,until,for,as

**Before**

>That man used to be a gangster before he joined the army.
>
>That man used to be a gangster before joining the army.

**连接词改为介系词**

将连接词改为意思接近的介系词，整个子句简化为介系词片语。

Although

可改为despite,despite of

>The girl is determined to marry her bofriend although her parents object strongly.
>
>The girl is determined to marry her bofriend despite her parents' strong  objection.

>Although he was not told to enter,the salesperson came in.
>
>Without being told to enter,the salesperson came in.


Because

可改为because of,owing to,due to,as a result of,with等介系词

>The little resort town is crowded because there has been an influx of tourist.
>
>The little resort town is crowded,with an influx of tourist.

>Because he has prepared adequately,the student did well at the exam.
>
>As a result of adequate preparation,the student did well at the exam.

When 

可改为on,upon,at等

>When she heard her child cry,the woman rushed into the bedroom.
>
>On hearing her child cry,the woman rushed into the bedroom.

If

可改为in case of

>If the river rises above the red line,the village nearby will be evacuated.
>
>In case of the river rising above the red line,the village nearby will be evacuated.
