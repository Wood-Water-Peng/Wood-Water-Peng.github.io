场景：
Ruth在电话里邀请Martin去看演讲
>Quite irrelevantly,**still at the telephone and talking with her**,he felt an overpowering desire to die for her,and visions of heroric sacriface shaped and dissolved in his whirling brain.

<!-- more --> 

>此刻在电话上和她交谈着，他心里却胡思乱想，产生了一种愿为她一死的强烈欲望，于是，一幕幕英勇献身的场面在他那眩晕的大脑里形成又消失。

分析：黑色字体部分可以看成while he was still at the telephone and talking with her的省略形式。




场景:Martin和Ruth走在路边,而Martin此时正在纠结"绅士走外侧"的礼仪问题
>Yet he was not satisfied with his conclusion,and **when he found himself on the inside**,he talked quickly and earnestly,**making a show of being carried away by what he was saying**,so that,**in case he was wrong in not changing sides**,his enthusiasm would seem the cause for his carelessness.

>可他对自己的这个决定并不满意,当走到内侧的时候,他就快言快语,热情的讲话,显示出一幅入神的样子,这样,万一没调换位置是件错事,也会让她觉得他是因为过于专心致志才导致了疏忽大意。  

分析:由于句子很长，我们可以先将黑色部分的状语从句去掉  
  Yet he was not satisfied with his conclusion,and he talked quickly and earnestly,so that,his enthusiasm would seem the cause for his carelessness.  
这是一个又yet,and,so that连接起来的并列句。




场景:Martin和Ruth在百老汇大街碰到一个工人阶级的女性朋友
>She noded and looked at him boldly,**not with soft and gentle eyes like Ruth's,but with eyes that were handsome and hard**,and that swep past him to Ruth and itemized her face and dress and station.

>她点点头,向他射来大胆的目光,她的眼睛不似露丝那般温柔、和顺,而是俊俏中带点严厉,只见她的目光从他身上转向露丝,端详她的面孔、衣服,揣测她的身份.

>And he was aware that Ruth looked,too,**with quick eyes that were timid and mild as a dove's**,but which saw,in a look that was a flutter on and past,the working class girl **in her cheap finery** and **under the strange hat** that all working-class girls were wearing just then.

>他察觉到,露丝也在飞眼打量对方.露丝的眼神似鸽子一般既胆怯又柔顺,但她眼疾一瞥就看到那个工人阶层的姑凉身裹廉价的俗丽衣服、头戴当时在年轻工女中十分流行的怪模怪样的帽子.

分析:经济基础决定上层建筑




场景:Martin回到家之后的所思所想
>And yet you dare to open the books,to listen to beautiful music,to learn to love beautiful paintings,to speak good English,to think thoughts that none of your own kinds thinks,to tear yourself away from the oxen and the Lizziz and to love a pale spirit of a woman who is a million miles beyond you and who lives in the stars!

>你竟敢翻开书本、倾听优美的音乐、学习欣赏美丽的油画、讲地道的英语、思考你的同类绝对想不到的问题；你竟敢离开牛群以及丽茜那些姑凉去爱一个距你一百万英里、生活在星空上的仙女！

分析:句子的意思比结构重要
